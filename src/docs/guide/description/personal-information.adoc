= Personal Information

Personal details about the applicant. Only used in EHF CV, not in EHF CV Request.

A social media can only include either element `cv-req:type` or `cv-req:title`. Use type if the
specific social media is defined in the clearance code list, otherwise use the title.
Note that, every social media needs to consist of either a title or a type that identifies the
specific social media.
