= Clearance

Jobs within certain departments of the government or private sectors may require that employees
have a security clearance.

== Information specific to CV request

A Contracting Authority can state a clearance requirement if a person shall work with information graded Confidential or higher.

The element `cv-req:Requirement` shall be used to state if the clerarance *should* or *must* be present.

Contracting Authorities must specify the level of clearance (`cv-req:Level`) by using codelist
clearance level. Note that the clearance level is a minimum requirement, which means candidate with
higher level of clearance is qualified.

The Contracting Authority may specify an expiration date (`cv-req:ExpirationDate`), which defines the time period
the clearance needs to be active.
