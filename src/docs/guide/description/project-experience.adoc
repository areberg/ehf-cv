= Project Experience

Project experience describes specific projects that the candidate has been a part of.
Note that this is not the same as work experience.

== Information specific to CV request

A Contracting Authority can specify a request for a project experience in several ways.
For each project experience, there must be an experience type. In some cases it may be relevant to request project experience
related to a specific industry, workplace (country) or sector.

The total years of experience can be specified in element `cv-req:RequiredTotalExperience`. It is also possible to specify a
minimum number of years (`cv-req:MinimumExperience`) and a maximum number of years (`cv-req:MaximumExperience`). The candidate must fulfill
the minimum requirement. Another option is to have either minimum or maximum years of project excperience.

In the CV request, the Contracting Authority can state the requested period for a project experience using element
`cv-req:Period`. This implies that the candidate can only refer to project experience from this period. As an example
a Contracting Authority may request information about project experience from the last five years.

The description of experience needs to be provided in element `cv-req:ExperienceDescription`, where the candidate's role must
be specified in element `cv-req:Role`. It is also possible to describe the project activities and candidate's project
position percent (e.g. must have worked 100% with the project).

The project value can be stated in element `cv-req:ExperienceValue`, where the Contracting Authority can specify the candidate's
project participation (normally months), the size of project and the total value of the project.

== Information specific to CV

Based on the project experience requirement from CV request, the Economic Operator must document the candidate's project experience.
The element `cv:EducationReference` and `cv:ProjectExperienceReference` needs to be used in the procurement process,
not in the job application process. The education reference corresponds to the educational requirement in the CV request when
the contracting authority accepts relevant experience. The project experience reference corresponds to project experience in the
CV request.
