= Education

Education may be specified in CV request and CV to state the requirements and the level of education of the relevant candidates.

== Information specific to CV request

A Contracting Authority can state both an educational requirement and an alternative requirement for the candidate.
The alternative requirement is optional, but it might be relevant to accept other educations in some cases.
The alternative requirements include the same information elements as the original requirement.

All educations need to be identified uniquely to ensure that the education can be referenced in the CV.

The element `cv-req:Requirement` shall be used to differentiate between educations that *should* and *must* be present. The Economic Operators
will only provide qualified candidates to make it easier to do the rating.
