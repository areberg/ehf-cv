= Language skills

Language skills may be specified in CV request and CV. For certain assignments the language skill may be of 
great importance.

== Information specific to CV request

A Contracting Authority can state both a specific language requirement and an alternative requirement.
The alternative requirement is optional, but should be used if an alternative language is accepted.
As an example some Norwegian entities use Norwegian as primarily work language but may accept Swedish and Danish.
There is also possible to require several languages, for example Norwegian and English.
Note that the alternative requirements include the same information elements as the original requirement.

All language skills need to be identified uniquely, to ensure that the language skill can be referenced in the CV.
The element `cv-req:Requirement` shall be used to differentiate between languages skills that *should* and *must* be present.

Oral skill and written skill must be provided for each language skill requirement. The skill levels are based on
EU global standard. Note that the skill level is a minimum requirement. For example, the Contracting Authority wants a candidate
with a `B1` oral skill level. The candidate has an oral skill level on `A1`, which implies that the candidate is qualified.
Also note that if Scandinavian is set to true, this will overrule the skill requirements between no, sv and dk.
