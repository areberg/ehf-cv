= Background

Candidates, Contracting Authorities, and Economic operators create the CV in different ways, with different layouts.
This often leads to poor information (data) quality, evaluation of candidates can be difficult and, using a lot of time
to understand and interpret the content, etc. The CV-process can be easier by using standard formats.

The purpose of standardizing the CV is to save time for contracting authority, economic operator, and candidates, in addition
ensuring good quality of information (data). By structuring the information, we can obtain:

* Easier and faster process: specification and documentation of requirements and criteria
* Better CV: increasing quality of information -saves time
* Reuse of content
* Reduces cost and resources can focus on other tasks
