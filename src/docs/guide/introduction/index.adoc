= Introduction

Curriculum Vitaes (CV's) are created in different ways and with different layouts both in procurement processes
and job application processes. Contracting authorities, Economic operators and job seekers must relate to different formats when describing skills and competences.
This often leads to poor information quality and ambiguity which makes the the evaluation of providers and candidates difficult.

The purpose of this EHF-CV specification is to define and describe a common format for the Curriculum Vitae (CV) messages
(in the European procurement market) to be used in both a procurement process and in job applications.
