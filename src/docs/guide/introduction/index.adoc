= Introduction

Curriculum Vitaes (CV's) are created in different ways and with different layouts both in procurement processes
and other processes where CV's are used. Contracting Authorities and Economic Operators must relate to different formats when describing skills and competences.
This often leads to poor information quality and ambiguity which makes the evaluation of providers and candidates difficult and time consuming.  

The purpose of this EHF-CV specification is to define and describe a common format for the Curriculum Vitae (CV) messages to be used in a procurement process. 
This includes both the tender process in Pre Award and the follow-up of contract information in Post Award.
