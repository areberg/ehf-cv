== Use Cases

=== Use Case 1

The Norwegian Digitalisation Agency needs developer expertise for one of its projects. They have decided to acquire this
expertise through Dynamic Procurement System (DPS) procedure. In order to streamline the processing and evaluation of
incoming CVs from all suppliers located in the supplier database, they have decided to set requirements and criteria for
the consultant's competence in their tender system based on EHF CV. Thus, requirements that can be set can be automatically
evaluated against the submitted CVs.

Tenderer logs into the tender system and finds the template for CV request. He wants the consultant to answer the
following areas:


* Education:

** Achieved relevant master's degree related to the development assignment
** Long and particularly relevant experience can to some extent compensate for the education requirement:

*** Relevant courses
*** Certifications that are relevant
*** Language (fluent English written and oral)
*** Relevant assignments
*** Work Experience
**** References
*** Other reference
*** Other skills
*** Personal characteristics
*** Availability


The fields in the form links to the evaluation model in order to rank the candidates automatically.

EHF pre-award catalogue request is been used for the suppliers to be able to set the hourly rate for the different
developer profiles. Rest of the procurement documents are been attached.

The entire package is sent to all suppliers located in the supplier register for DPS via the Peppol network.

The supplier receives the tender documents and upload the CV request in their own system where requirements for
competence are shown. The supplier fills in the various fields and pastes links to proof or uploads PDF attachments
as proof of the competence of the candidate. Hourly rates are filled in the EHF pre-award catalogue. When the tender
document is been filled out it will be sent, via the Peppol network, to Norwegian Digitalisation Agency access point.

Norwegian Digitalisation Agency receives 49 CVs from 15 different suppliers. The competition system sorts, evaluates
the different fields and comes out with a ranking. Tender staff checks some of the CVs that need this especially those
who do not meet the education requirement but have filled in long and particularly relevant experience to compensate
for lack of education. The offers are also ranked in terms of hourly rates against the competence requirements. When
the selected supplier is decided, a message from the competition system is sent to Doffin informing about which supplier
is selected.
